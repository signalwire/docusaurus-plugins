# Plugin Development

Learn how to create custom Docusaurus plugins to extend your site's functionality.

For more advanced topics, see the [Advanced Topics overview](/docs/category/advanced-topics). You might also be interested in our [Guides section](/docs/guides/) and our [Custom Sidebar Category](/docs/category/custom-sidebar-category).

## Getting Started

Docusaurus plugins follow a specific structure and lifecycle. Here's what you need to know:

### Plugin Structure

```javascript
module.exports = function myPlugin(context, options) {
  return {
    name: 'my-custom-plugin',
    
    async loadContent() {
      // Load your content
    },
    
    async contentLoaded({content, actions}) {
      // Process loaded content
    },
    
    async postBuild(props) {
      // Run after build
    }
  };
};
```

## Plugin Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Plugin is loaded with context and options
2. **Content Loading**: `loadContent()` is called
3. **Content Processing**: `contentLoaded()` processes the content
4. **Build**: Site is built
5. **Post Build**: `postBuild()` runs after build completion

## Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Follow Docusaurus conventions
- Document your plugin thoroughly
- Test with different configurations
