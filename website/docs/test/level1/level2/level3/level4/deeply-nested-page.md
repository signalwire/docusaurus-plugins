# Extremely Long Page Title With Many Words To Test Breadcrumb Overflow Behavior

This page is deeply nested to test how the Copy Page button behaves when breadcrumbs get very long.

## Content

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with [docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new).

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm create docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.
